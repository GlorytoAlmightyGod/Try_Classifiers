# Try_Classifiers

    - This program **can be used to any dataset with any number of labels** with the assumption that first coloumn is the desired         value and rest of the coloumns are training parameters/labels/independent variables etc.
    
    - Attached program analyzes these models one by one -> Linear regression, Polynomial regression, SVM, Random Forests.

    - One could easily increase the analyzed models by just adding an appropriate new line for corresponding model in the code.

    - Results for each model are printed on the terminal for models in the same order mentioned in the first point.
